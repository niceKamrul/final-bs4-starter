# Final Bootstrap 4 Starter File
PSD to HTML5 conversion starter folder - Prepared for VSCode. 

###### Personally I find this is the best way to edit and compile bootstraps scss files using VSCode. 
<br>

### How to use:

1. Download the zip folder.
2. Extract and open the folder in VSCode.
3. You will find all the bootstrap scss files inside the scss folder.
4. You need to install Live Server and Live Sass Compiler (by Ritwick Dey) extensions in your VSCode.
5. The folder .vscode holds the settings for Live Sass Compiler.
6. Edit index.htm, put all your custom variables inside _custom-var.scss files and wright your css in _my-styles.scss file.
7. Click on the "Watch Sass" button and style.min.css file will be created or changed accordingly.
